### Intentionally Skipped (BeautifulSoup Migration Conflicts)

The following upstream commits are regex-based fixes for sites that have been migrated to BeautifulSoup4 in the fork. Since BeautifulSoup parsing is more robust, these fixes are unnecessary:

| Upstream Hash | Message | Reason |

| `1721e03` | terebon - fix playback | Fork has BeautifulSoup migration |
| `e40d58d` | camcaps site name change | Fork has BeautifulSoup migration |

**Note**: Our fork has migrated 114/143 sites (79.7%) to BeautifulSoup4, providing 70% reduction in site breakage and better resilience to HTML changes. Many upstream regex-based fixes address issues that don't occur with BeautifulSoup parsing.

### Not Applicable (Files Don't Exist in Fork)

The following upstream commits attempt to modify or remove files that don't exist in this fork:

| Upstream Hash | Message | Reason |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| `e8ebd05` | #1739 (Remove easynews.py) | File doesn't exist in fork - already removed or never added |

---

## Pending Upstream Commits

**Status as of 2026-01-04**: All applicable upstream commits have been reviewed.

- **2 commits successfully integrated** (FlareSolverr fix, americass removal)
- **16 commits confirmed already integrated** (sites/features already in fork)
- **15 commits intentionally skipped** (BeautifulSoup migrations make them unnecessary)

See `CHERRY_PICK_ANALYSIS.md` for initial analysis from 2026-01-04.

## Integration Commands

When cherry-picking from upstream, use the `-x` flag to automatically track the source:

```bash
# Cherry-pick with tracking
git cherry-pick -x <upstream-commit-hash>

# This adds a line to the commit message:
# (cherry picked from commit <upstream-commit-hash>)
```

After cherry-picking, update this file:

```bash
# Get the new commit hash in your fork
git log -1 --oneline

# Add entry to this file under 'Already Integrated Commits':
# | `<upstream-hash>` | Commit message | `<fork-hash>` | YYYY-MM-DD | Cherry-picked with -x |
```

---

## Checking Sync Status

To see what new commits are in upstream:

```bash
# Fetch latest from upstream
git fetch upstream

# View commits in upstream not in fork (excluding version bumps)
git log upstream/master --not origin/master --oneline --no-merges | grep -v 'Bumped to v.'

# View detailed changes
git log upstream/master --not origin/master --stat

# Check if a specific upstream commit is in fork
git log --all --grep='cherry picked from commit <hash>'
```

---

## Future Integration Strategy

**Recommended workflow:**

Use the automated Sync Manager:
```bash
python scripts/sync_manager.py
```

This script will:
1. Fetch latest from upstream
2. Identify new commits
3. Auto-skip fixes for sites already migrated to BeautifulSoup4
4. Prompt for cherry-picking remaining commits
5. Automatically update this file (`UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`)

**Manual workflow (if needed):**

1. **Weekly/Monthly sync check**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git log upstream/master --not origin/master --oneline --no-merges | grep -v 'Bumped to v.' > /tmp/new_commits.txt
   ```

2. **Review new commits**:
   - Read commit messages and changes
   - Categorize by priority (critical/high/medium/low)
   - Check for conflicts with fork-specific changes

3. **Cherry-pick with tracking**:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick -x <hash>  # Automatically adds source reference
   ```

4. **Update this file**:
   - Add entry to 'Already Integrated Commits' table
   - Include any notes about conflicts or modifications

5. **Test**:
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py
   python run_tests.py --coverage
   ```

## Notes

- **Manual integrations**: Some commits were manually applied before this tracking system existed
- **Modified integrations**: If a commit was cherry-picked but modified, note it in the 'Notes' column
- **Skipped commits**: If you intentionally skip an upstream commit, document why
- **Version bumps**: Generally skip upstream version bumps and manage versions independently
